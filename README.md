Important note: This is a demo project created as part of Module 1: Responsive Web Page for the Wing Scholarship program. I acknowledge that I have intergrated with AI tools including ChatGPT as well as Warp as assistant in helping me achieve this responsive web page for my homework in the first week of the program. For useful and creative ideas in the process, I have gone through loads of aligend and conflicting percepion on how to make this webpage happen regarding cleaner styles and shorter and equally effective excecuation of codes. Therefore, I believe that it will be a good step that I take and hopefully, it builds my foundation as a software developer at the begining of the Full-stack development course in order to equip with practical skills and experiences in the future.
